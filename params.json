The complex nature of the data demands sophisticated mathematical models to tease out faint signals, and machine learning algorithms to separate terrestrial interference from true signals of interest. These requirements are well suited to the scalable in-memory capabilities offered by IBM Apache Spark Services.\r\nYou can learn more by visiting the [project web page](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ebusiness/jstart/portfolio/seti.html), or by reading [blogs from the project team](http://blog.ibmjstart.net/2015/07/14/seti-sparks-machine-learning-to-sift-big-data/)\r\n\r\n### jStart - IBM Emerging Technology\r\nThe jStart mission within IBM is to leverage emerging technologies to address real and current business needs of IBM clients. One area of focus for the jStart team is the rapid adoption of [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) as a key platform for complex analytics of large data sets. IBM announced its [strategic commitment](https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/47107.wss) to Spark in June 2015, and jStart activities are a core component how we apply [IBM Spark Services](http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/) for customer success. You can learn more about IBM jStart and our project portfolio at the [jStart webpage](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ebusiness/jstart/).\r\n\r\n### The SETI Institute\r\nThe SETI Institute’s mission is to explore, understand and explain the origin and nature of life in the universe. A central element of the Institute’s operations is the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) located in the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in California. This phased array observatory combines over 40 radio dishes to look for faint signals which may betray the presence of intelligent extraterrestrial life.  Making sense of the data produced by this installation demands advanced analytics, which must scale to handle the ATA data stream of over 60 gigabits of data per second. You can learn more about by visiting the [SETI Institute website](http://www.seti.org/).\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nFor more information on this project and this github repository, please contact the [IBM jStart team](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ebusiness/jstart/contact.shtml), or connect with Adam Cox (@gadamc).",
